Hell is other people's comments. If you start typing on google "Don't rea" it will suggest you "Don't read the comments". The first result for that search is the @AvoidComments Twitter account. That account has almost 40K followers! That's a lot of people thinking comments are awful.

Not all is bad though, I'm sure you have got some good feedback at some point in your life. Good comments exist, but they're outnumbered by bad ones. Are you not tired of that? Are you not tired of digging through bad feedback in order to reach the tiny piece of gold that's lost there? I am. I want to rise the bar. If it's possible to build a particle acelerator then it's possible to write useful comments. Do you want to know how?

#### Ignore bad feedback

First of all, you'll be much happier if you ignore bad feedback. And I don't mean feedback that points out you're mistakes and tries to help you. I mean judgamental and destructive feedback. You know, hater's gonna hate.

#### Think (at least) twice

Don't wish for others what you don't want for yourself (http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/699548-don-t-do-unto-others-what-you-don-t-want-others-to)

Sometimes you just get carried away. You can't help it! But think about this. Are you really helping or are you just trying to impose your idea? There's a huge difference.

#### Don't judge

Search for the word stupid on Twitter and, even if you filter by the people you're following, you'll get depressed. (https://twitter.com/search?f=follows&q=stupid&src=typd)

#### Empathize

You're giving feedback to a person. Try to understand they're motivations. Maybe you were missing something.

#### Give options

"I don't like that"

That's probably one of the less useful feedback you can give to someone, but it's one of the more common ones to get. What can you do with something like that? It needs to be followed by some reasons and alternatives.

Nobody likes to hear "Hey, this is not bad, but I think it needs a better name". Don't be lazy and give an example. If you do not come up with one then don't share your thoughts. It's not fair to give all the responsibility to the other person.

#### Explain yourself

Always explain why are you giving that feedback. And "because you asked me too" is not a very good reason. Take some time to explain why you're saying what you're saying.
