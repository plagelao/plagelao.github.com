The worst part of the internet is other people's comments. This is not mine. If you start typing on google "Don't rea" it will suggest you "Don't read the comments"! The first result for that search is the @AvoidComments Twitter account. That accounts has almost 40K followers! A lot of people think comments are awful. There's other people that defend comments. There's Jeff Atwood saying that, even comments are mostly rants, the community should moderate them. I think differently. I think we should rise the bar and learn how to give useful feedback. If we can learn how to build a particle acelerator we can learn how to give usefule feedback. Do you want to know how?

You've seen it on Twitter. You've seen it on github. You've seen it at work. You've seen it at home. Feedback is every where. Regretfully, almost none of it is useful. Why? Let's find an answer.


Do not judge.
Give constructive feedback.
Take your time. Care to ellaborate your point.
Empathize

Don't wish for others what you don't want for yourself
