Let's see how github blogs work!

I've been blogging for a long time (well, not that long) on [Blogger](http://plagelao.blogspot.com). It was ok, and it served my purpose at that moment, but I think it is time to change.

I'm going to start blogging here, on Github, at least for now...

Since I don't want to spend a lot of time right now with the css, the feed or the comments, I just copied [Chris Parsons Github blog](https://github.com/chrismdp/chrismdp.github.com) (Thank you, Chris). I promise I'll change it in the future.

See you!
